# olcPGE-UniverseGeneration-Rust
 An attempt to learn rust by translating Javidx9's (OneLoneCoder) procedural universe generation tutorial in the Rust version of the olc pixel game engine. This code is bad. Please bear in mind there is a lot of bodging and im learning rust so using this code as any kind of refrence is a bad idea. That being said it is a CC0 license so do what you want with it, but im not responsible if it causes issues and I don't have the ability to provide updates/support.
