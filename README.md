# olcPGE-UniverseGeneration-Rust
 An attempt to learn rust by translating Javidx9's (OneLoneCoder) procedural universe generation tutorial in the Rust version of the olc pixel game engine. 
 
This is early code from a primarily python oriented developer.
That being said it is a CC0 license so do what you want with it.
